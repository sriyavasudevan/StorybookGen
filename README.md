# StorybookGen
An immersive journey for parent and child to create whimsical and personal stories that will stay with them for a lifetime.

# Background
This project has been in the drafts ever since the world was blessed with my wonderful niece. I want to introduce her to wonderful worlds where she is the star in them and gets to make creative choices right from the beginning. What better way to do that than to create stories from her wildest imaginations that can teach us of adventure, kindness and love. 

# Ideas
- Use LLMs to fill in gaps with more expansive storytelling - we still want to encourage creativity with children/parents and think of the LLM as a co-editor or even a scribe
- Take each of the text pieces generated and feed into Text-2-Image models to generate instant story book pages

# Caveats
Not sure how I feek about publishing books with AI generated art, I will need to do more research on licensing
